#### By _**Alondra Warren**_

## Description

_This Peek-a-Boo webpage is simply a page to help us practice with jQuery effects. This week we were introduced to Javascript and jQuery. The two allow us to make our web pages interactive, as opposed to just writing the code to create them._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Set up at a computer with Internet access_
* _Move the cursor around the page to see how the toggle element functions_
* _Keep watch over what shows and what hides_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_
